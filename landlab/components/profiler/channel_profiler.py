"""channel_profiler.py component to create channel profiles."""

import numpy as np

from landlab.components.profiler.base_profiler import _BaseProfiler


class ChannelProfiler(_BaseProfiler):
    """Extract and plot the long profiles within a drainage network.

    The ChannelProfiler can work on grids that have used route-to-one or
    route-to-multiple flow directing. This component expects that all of the
    following at-node grid fields will be present:

        'drainage_area'
        'flow__receiver_node'
        'flow__link_to_receiver_node'

    These are typically created by using the FlowAccumulator component.

    Four parameters control the behavior of this component. By default, the
    component will extract the single largest channel in the drainage network
    up to a drainage area below a threshold of two times the cell area.

    Providing a value for the parameter ``threshold`` changes this value.
    Setting ``main_channel_only`` to ``False`` will plot all of the channels in
    each watershed that have drainage area below the threshold. The number of
    watersheds can be changed from one based on the parameter
    ``number_of_watersheds``. By default the ChannelProfiler will identify the
    largest watersheds and use them. If instead you want to extract the channel
    network draining to specific nodes, you can provide values for the
    parameter ``starting_nodes``. The length of ``starting_nodes`` must be
    consistent with the value of ``number_of_watersheds``.  The node IDs of the
    ``starting_nodes`` do not need to be on the domain boundaries or the
    outlets of watersheds. They do need to have drainage area above the
    indicated threshold.

    The ``run_one_step`` method extracts the channel network and stores it in
    the ``profile_structure`` and ``distances_upstream`` bound properties. To
    make a plot of distance-upstream vs an at-node value use the method
    ``plot_profiles``. To make a plot of the location of profiles in map view
    use ``plot_profiles_in_map_view``.

    Examples
    ---------

    Start by importing necessary modules

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.random.seed(42)
    >>> from landlab import RasterModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import (FlowAccumulator,
    ...                                 FastscapeEroder,
    ...                                 ChannelProfiler)

    Construct a grid and set up components necessary to evolve some topography

    >>> mg = RasterModelGrid(40, 60)
    >>> z = mg.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
    >>> z += 200 + mg.x_of_node + mg.y_of_node
    >>> mg.set_closed_boundaries_at_grid_edges(bottom_is_closed=True,
    ...                                        left_is_closed=True,
    ...                                        right_is_closed=True,
    ...                                        top_is_closed=True)
    >>> mg.set_watershed_boundary_condition_outlet_id(0, z, -9999)
    >>> fa = FlowAccumulator(mg, flow_director='D8')
    >>> sp = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=.0001, m_sp=.5, n_sp=1)

    Now run our simple landscape evolution model to develop a channel network.

    >>> dt = 100
    >>> for i in range(200):
    ...     fa.run_one_step()
    ...     sp.run_one_step(dt=dt)
    ...     mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'][0] -= 0.001

    Next we construct the ChannelProfiler component and run ``run_one_step`` to
    extract the channel network.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg)
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()

    This creates the profile structure and distances upstream structure. Since
    we used the default values this will make only one profile, the biggest
    channel in the biggest stream network in the catchemnt.

    profile_structure will be a length 1 array and will contain one array that
    is the length in number of nodes of the single longest channel

    >>> len(profiler.profile_structure) == 1
    True

    >>> len(profiler.profile_structure[0][0])
    58

    We can change the default values to get additional channels or to plot all
    of the channels in a network.

    For the next example, lets use a hexagonal grid.

    >>> from landlab import HexModelGrid
    >>> from landlab.components import (
    ...     DepressionFinderAndRouter,
    ...     LinearDiffuser)
    >>> mg = HexModelGrid(40, 20)
    >>> z = mg.add_zeros('topographic__elevation', at='node')
    >>> z += (200
    ...       + mg.x_of_node
    ...       + mg.y_of_node
    ...       + np.random.randn(mg.size('node')))
    >>> fa = FlowAccumulator(mg, depression_finder=DepressionFinderAndRouter)
    >>> sp = FastscapeEroder(mg, K_sp=.0001, m_sp=.5, n_sp=1)
    >>> ld = LinearDiffuser(mg, linear_diffusivity=0.0001)

    Now run a simple landscape evolution model to develop a channel network.

    >>> dt = 100
    >>> for i in range(200):
    ...     fa.run_one_step()
    ...     flooded = np.where(fa.depression_finder.flood_status==3)[0]
    ...     sp.run_one_step(dt=dt,  flooded_nodes=flooded)
    ...     ld.run_one_step(dt=dt)
    ...     mg.at_node['topographic__elevation'][0] -= 0.001

    This time we will use some non-default values. Providing the threshold in
    units of area indicates where the channel network will end.
    main_channel_only = False indicates that all parts of the stream network

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg,
    ...                            threshold = 100,
    ...                            main_channel_only=False,
    ...                            number_of_watersheds=3)
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()

    This will create three channel networks. The attributes profile_structure
    and distances_upstream will both be length 3

    >>> len(profiler.profile_structure) == len(profiler.distances_upstream) == 3
    True

    We can also specify exactly which node is the outlet for the channel.

    >>> profiler = ChannelProfiler(mg,
    ...                            threshold = 300,
    ...                            starting_nodes = [0],
    ...                            number_of_watersheds=1)
    >>> profiler.run_one_step()
    >>> np.testing.assert_array_equal(
    ...     profiler.profile_structure[0][0],
    ...     np.array([ 0, 21, 22, 23, 24], dtype=np.int64))

    It is important that the length of starting nodes is the same as the value
    of number_of_watersheds. If this is not the case, then an error will occur.
